  <h3>Mission</h3>
  <p>This site provides a growing online collection of pedagogical resources that faculty who teach with digital resources can use in the courses that they teach.</p>
  <p>Originally designed to support faculty in the Virginia Tech Department of English who teach courses online and who use digital resources in campus classrooms, this public collection allows teachers in all departments and at other colleges and universities to take advantage of the resources. All materials on the site are shared under Creative Commons licensing, unless otherwise noted.</p>
  <h3>Supporting Research</h3>
  <p>To thrive, a  learning community, or community of practice, needs solidly-defined, shared goals and values, which serve to strengthen the connections the community is built upon. Wenger, McDermott, and Snyder (2002) identify three connections that are necessary for these communities: “A domain of knowledge, which defines a set of issues; a community of people who care about this domain; and the shared practice that they are developing to be effective in their domain.”  These connections contribute to positive learning experiences. As Palloff and Pratt explain in Building Online Learning Communities (2007), “The formation of a learning community through which knowledge is imparted and meaning is co-created sets the stage for successful learning outcomes.”</p>
  <p>Establishing a learning community in the Department of English to support faculty working toward certification and improvement of the online courses that they teach. Further, this community-based approach will model online teaching strategies and community building techniques that community members can use in their online classes. 
To ensure the learning community follows high-quality practices, the supporting events and resources will be developed according to the Standards from the Quality Matters® Higher Education Rubric, Fifth Edition (2014).</p>

  <h3>Support</h3>
  <p>This site was created with support of a High-Impact Project Grant from the <a href="https://teaching.vt.edu/" target="_blank">Virginia Tech Center for Teaching and Learning</a>.</p>
