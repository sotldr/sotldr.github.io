Students typically have experience with the concepts and techniques that we ask them to use in class. They may have learned the basics of a concept in a high school classroom. It’s possible that they experimented with a specific technique while working on Girl Scout badges. Perhaps an idea is mentioned in a song they heard or a video they watched. They may have observed someone else using the technique.</p>
<p>So why does this previous experience with concepts and skills matter? Activating prior knowledge is critical to learning because “We all, whether as a toddler or a centenarian, bring diverse bits of background knowledge—consciously or subconsciously—to every subsequent experience, and we use them to connect or glue new information to old.” (Lent 2016).  Previous knowledge is both a starting point for new learning and a foundation that supports that new learning.</p>
<p>Uncovering prior knowledge also tells us as teachers where the gaps are in students’ understanding, allowing us to customize instruction to the class. Rather than repeating what students already know, we can focus on correcting any misremembered ideas and reminding them of forgotten concepts. As Lent explains, “Once you have gained insights about what your students know, you can create lessons that target specific learning, something textbooks simply cannot do. It takes a teacher who knows his students to differentiate, and the more you assess background knowledge and teach to your students' strengths, the better you will become at focusing your instruction.”</p>
<h3>Active Learning Strategies Focusing on Background Knowledge</h3>
<p>In today’s post, I share several active learning strategies that work well online to activate students’ prior knowledge. . </p>
<dl>
<dt>Background Knowledge Check</dt>
	<dd>The simplest way to activate prior knowledge is to ask students directly. You can ask students to brainstorm ideas as a whole class or in groups by adding ideas to collaborative Google Documents or an online whiteboard (like <a href="https://padlet.com/" target="_blank">Padlet</a> or <a href="http://en.linoit.com/" target="_blank">Lino</a>). For individual work, ask students to write out everything they recall about the concept or technique. I have students complete a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GUQBHjyqK6W2FcMM-5Q0-0t-xqfdcLEbdLY7gyS5x8w/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Brain Dump</a> activity early in the term in courses that I teach, providing them with several questions that encourage them to write down their background knowledge in an assignment in Canvas or a shared document in Google Docs. Students can write as much or as little as appropriate for your course. </dd>
<dt>Found Objects (Artifacts)</dt>
	<dd>Ask students to find an object  that relates to the concept or technique. Depending upon your situation, students can search for actual objects or digital images of the objects. Have students share a photo of the object and explain how it relates to the concept or technique. <br>
