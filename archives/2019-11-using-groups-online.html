  <p>Activating the prior knowledge students bring to class is a key educational strategy. Students typically have experience with the concepts and techniques that we ask them to use in class. They may have learned the basics of a concept in a high school classroom. It’s possible that they experimented with a specific technique while working on Girl Scout badges. Perhaps an idea is mentioned in a song they heard, a video they watched, or a textbook chapter they read. They may have observed someone else using the technique.</p>
<p>So why does this previous experience with concepts and skills matter? Activating prior knowledge is critical to learning because “We all, whether as a toddler or a centenarian, bring diverse bits of background knowledge—consciously or subconsciously—to every subsequent experience, and we use them to connect or glue new information to old.” (Lent 2016).  Previous knowledge is both a starting point for new learning and a foundation that supports that new learning.</p>
<p>Uncovering prior knowledge also tells us as teachers where the gaps are in students’ understanding, allowing us to customize instruction to the class. Rather than repeating what students already know, we can focus on correcting any misremembered ideas and reminding them of forgotten concepts. As Lent explains, “Once you have gained insights about what your students know, you can create lessons that target specific learning, something textbooks simply cannot do. It takes a teacher who knows his students to differentiate, and the more you assess background knowledge and teach to your students' strengths, the better you will become at focusing your instruction.”</p>
<h3>Strategies Focusing on Background Knowledge</h3>
<p>The following active learning strategies  work well online to activate students’ prior knowledge. Each asks students to recall information that they already know about a topic or technique. Some also ask students to use or apply that knowledge in a specific context.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Background Knowledge Check</dt>
	<dd>The simplest way to activate prior knowledge is to ask students directly. You can ask students to brainstorm ideas as a whole class or in groups by adding ideas to collaborative Google Documents or an online whiteboard (like <a href="https://padlet.com/" target="_blank">Padlet</a> or <a href="http://en.linoit.com/" target="_blank">Lino</a>). For individual work, ask students to write out everything they recall about the concept or technique. <br>
	  <br>
    I have students complete a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GUQBHjyqK6W2FcMM-5Q0-0t-xqfdcLEbdLY7gyS5x8w/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Brain Dump</a> activity early in the term in courses that I teach, providing them with several questions that encourage them to write down their background knowledge in an assignment in Canvas or a shared document in Google Docs. Students can write as much or as little as appropriate for your course. </dd>
<dt>Found Objects (Artifacts)</dt>
	<dd>Ask students to find an object  that relates to the concept or technique. Depending upon your situation, students can search for actual objects or digital images of the objects. Have students share a photo of the object and explain how it relates to the concept or technique. In addition to activating each students’ prior knowledge, this activity can encourage students to build upon and extend one another’s knowledge. As students share digital images, they can add comments and reflect further on how the objects relate to the concept or technique.<br>
	  <br>
    I have asked students to identify <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iaHe4bV32XeYg_bqnGXXU52ArkQJQmOvxBUkQXhpZc4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">One Significant Object</a> that relates to writing in their field in Discussions in Canvas. As part of their activity, I usually ask students to read and reply to two classmates. While I focus on one object, you can ask students to find any number of objects. The activity easily works for any subject area. All you need to do is change the kinds of objects you ask students to find and discuss.</dd>
<dt>Minute Paper</dt>
	<dd>This strategy’s name explains everything: students are given one minute to write about a topic. A flexible activity, minute papers can be used to gather prior knowledge as well as gauge students’ understanding of concepts covered in class or a reading. I use a minute-papers strategy in Canvas Discussions when I ask students to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dr_GRNeIOYyEwPcEsA7XRyfUXoLEnfuZ_P42WdHn6jc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Share  Workplace Writing Secrets</a>. The activity can be modified for any subject area—just ask for relevant secrets for the project and field being covered.<br>
	  <br>
    In campus classrooms, students can work in any online text editor or word processor, with the teacher giving the signal of when to begin writing and when time is up. Working in virtual classes, students can work on their honor, as it is simple to tell if someone has spent significantly more than a minute on a response. Alternately, use one of the  options in Canvas that allows you to set a time limit, such as a timed Quiz. Do allow more than one minute for timed, online responses in case there are technology glitches. Additionally, with such fast writing, students will not produce polished content. Remind students that their writing is informal and they will be graded only for the ideas they share, not how well they spell or follow grammar rules.</dd>
<dt>Scavenger Hunt</dt>
	<dd>Similar to the Found Object activity, the Scavenger Hunt strategy asks students to find a variety of objects that meet specific criteria or demonstrate specific ideas related to the subject area. Activities can ask students to find any number of examples. When working online, students can take photos of their finds and share the images online. <br>
	  <br>
	  I use a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oOU1cvuDPZ030oNEfxUXDwxGL-TieHFvGf86xqpg7YY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Design Principles Scavenger Hunt</a> to ask students to demonstrate their understanding of basic design. Students post what they find during their hunts in Canvas Discussions, allowing the class to read and reply to what they share. Additionally, the activity provides a collection of student-found images that can be used later in the class as the principles are discussed further. <br>
	  <br>
	  Find another example in <a href="http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/113005/chapters/Background-Knowledge@-The-Glue-That-Makes-Learning-Stick.aspx" target="_blank">Lent’s chapter on background knowledge</a>, which includes suggestions for “Textbook Scavenger Hunts.” One item on her list asks students to “List three things to look up online that would help your group better understand this chapter” after reading. Students can share their responses  in assignments in Canvas or shared documents in Google Docs.</dd>
