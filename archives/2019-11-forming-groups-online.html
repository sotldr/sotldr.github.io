  <p>Asking students to complete activities in small groups builds their collaborative skills and encourages community support and learning. This month’s post focuses on ways to set up small groups that work in online courses.</p>
  <h3>What Does Research Say?</h3>
  <p>Teachers  play a significant role in the ways groups are established and how they work together, yet there is little evidence to guide them toward the most effective group formation.</p>
  <p>Kaye and Barrett (2018) assert, “[T]he complexity of social processes mean that we cannot naively assume that simply putting several students into the same online space will create a team. Rather we must learn how to provide effective environments to facilitate group formation and teamwork” (p. 60). </p>
  <p>Despite the importance of group formation, the most effective way to build groups online has not been established. Based on a review of 41 articles that examined aspects of online groups, Cherney, Fetherston and Johnsen (2018) found that “group size research shows conflicting results, and optimal group size in online students' work groups has not been empirically determined by existing research” (p. 103).  Further, the researchers concluded that the most effective way to form student groups is unclear, with conflicting opinions reflected in their sample (Cherney, Fetherston and Johnsen, 2018, p. 105).</p>
  <h3>Strategies for Setting Up Groups </h3>
<p>As with many aspects of teaching, the best strategies probably depend upon your situation, your students, and the kinds of work that they will do together. For each of the following ways of forming  groups online, consider how the option will work given your particular situation.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Group by Student Choice</dt>
	<dd>Allowing students to create form groups on their own can work in the face-to-face classroom, but it is a difficult strategy to use in fully online courses. Students do not know from a glance around the room which groups are too small and have infrequently built the personal connections that help students find others with like interests or complementary skills. In hybrid courses, student choice can be a useful choice however.<br>
	  <br>
      <button onclick="myShowHide()">See How to Set Student Choice Up in Canvas</button>
<div id="myDIV">
	  In Canvas, you can set up groups by student choice
	  by choosing the <em>Allow self sign-up</em> checkbox by the <em>Self Sign-Up</em> label (shown below with the online help popup) when you create a group set.<br>
	  <img src="../images/student-choice-groups.png" width="669" height="529" alt="Student Choice dialog in Canvas" style="margin-top: 15px;"></div>
	</dd>
<dt>Group by Section</dt>
	<dd>If you teach multiple sections of the same course, you may have chosen to create one online course that all sections have access to for assignments and online work. In such course configurations, creating a group set that is based on the sections in the course can help you manage due dates that differ by section as well as create groups large enough for discussion without being overwhelming. <br>
	  <br>
    In Canvas, use the options in the <em>Group Structure</em> section of the <em>Create Group Set</em> dialog to set up a group for each section. Tell Canvas to split the course into as many groups as you have sections. For instance, I teach four sections of Technical Writing, so I have indicated that I want four groups. Next, check the <em>Require group members to be in the same section</em> checkbox (shown in the image below). When you click the <em>Save</em> button, Canvas will automatically sort students into groups by course section.<br>

	</dd>
<dt>Group Randomly</dt>
	<dd>This strategy’s name explains everything: students are given one minute to write about a topic. A flexible activity, minute papers can be used to gather prior knowledge as well as gauge students’ understanding of concepts covered in class or a reading. I use a minute-papers strategy in Canvas Discussions when I ask students to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dr_GRNeIOYyEwPcEsA7XRyfUXoLEnfuZ_P42WdHn6jc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Share  Workplace Writing Secrets</a>. The activity can be modified for any subject area—just ask for relevant secrets for the project and field being covered.<br>
	</dd>
<dt>Group by Subject Area, Major, and/or College</dt>
	<dd>Similar to the Found Object activity, the Scavenger Hunt strategy asks students to find a variety of objects that meet specific criteria or demonstrate specific ideas related to the subject area. Activities can ask students to find any number of examples. When working online, students can take photos of their finds and share the images online. .</dd>
<dt>Group by Career Interest</dt>

<div>Collaborating Online provides practical guidance for faculty seeking to help their students work together in creative ways, move out of the box of traditional papers and projects, and deepen the learning experience through their work with one another. Authors Rena Palloff and Keith Pratt draw on their extensive knowledge and experience to show how collaboration brings students together to support the learning of each member of the group while promoting creativity and critical thinking. Collaborating Online is the second title in the Jossey-Bass Guides to Online Teaching and Learning. This series helps higher education professionals improve the practice of online teaching and learning by providing concise, practical resources focused on particular areas or issues they might confront in this new learning environment.</div>
