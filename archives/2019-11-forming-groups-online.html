  <p>Asking students to complete activities in small groups builds their collaborative skills and encourages community support and learning. This month’s post focuses on ways to set up small groups that work in online courses.</p>
  <h3>What Does Research Say?</h3>
  <p>Based on a review of 41 articles that examined aspects of online groups, Cherney, Fetherston and Johnsen (2018) found that “group size research shows conflicting results, and optimal group size in online students' work groups has not been empirically determined by existing research” (103).</p>
  <p>Likewise, the researchers found the most effective way to form student groups is unclear, with conflicting opinions reflected in their sample (Cherney, Fetherston and Johnsen, 2018, 105)</p>

  <p>Learning should be collaborative in nature. Online courses<br>
    should contain small-group activities and team projects where students<br>
  must collaborate, in order to foster an online community of learners.</p>
  <p>Facilitation of teamwork and multimedia projects. The barriers to<br>
  effective group-work are multiplied by the distance barriers of online</p>
  <p>teaching. Therefore, teachers must develop effective strategies to use<br>
    small group activities in their courses. For example, teachers need to<br>
    develop timelines for group activities that acknowledge the challenges<br>
    of working online across time zones. They need to provide students<br>
    with ways of forming teams when proximity or friendship are no<br>
  longer the criteria for selecting team members.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Activating the prior knowledge students bring to class is a key educational strategy. Students typically have experience with the concepts and techniques that we ask them to use in class. They may have learned the basics of a concept in a high school classroom. It’s possible that they experimented with a specific technique while working on Girl Scout badges. Perhaps an idea is mentioned in a song they heard, a video they watched, or a textbook chapter they read. They may have observed someone else using the technique.</p>
<p>So why does this previous experience with concepts and skills matter? Activating prior knowledge is critical to learning because “We all, whether as a toddler or a centenarian, bring diverse bits of background knowledge—consciously or subconsciously—to every subsequent experience, and we use them to connect or glue new information to old.” (Lent 2016).  Previous knowledge is both a starting point for new learning and a foundation that supports that new learning.</p>
<p>Uncovering prior knowledge also tells us as teachers where the gaps are in students’ understanding, allowing us to customize instruction to the class. Rather than repeating what students already know, we can focus on correcting any misremembered ideas and reminding them of forgotten concepts. As Lent explains, “Once you have gained insights about what your students know, you can create lessons that target specific learning, something textbooks simply cannot do. It takes a teacher who knows his students to differentiate, and the more you assess background knowledge and teach to your students' strengths, the better you will become at focusing your instruction.”</p>
<h3>Strategies for Setting Up Groups </h3>
<p>The following active learning strategies  work well online to activate students’ prior knowledge. Each asks students to recall information that they already know about a topic or technique. Some also ask students to use or apply that knowledge in a specific context.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Group by Student Choice</dt>
	<dd>The simplest way to activate prior knowledge is to ask students directly. You can ask students to brainstorm ideas as a whole class or in groups by adding ideas to collaborative Google Documents or an online whiteboard (like <a href="https://padlet.com/" target="_blank">Padlet</a> or <a href="http://en.linoit.com/" target="_blank">Lino</a>). For individual work, ask students to write out everything they recall about the concept or technique. <br>
	  <br>
    I have students complete a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GUQBHjyqK6W2FcMM-5Q0-0t-xqfdcLEbdLY7gyS5x8w/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Brain Dump</a> activity early in the term in courses that I teach, providing them with several questions that encourage them to write down their background knowledge in an assignment in Canvas or a shared document in Google Docs. Students can write as much or as little as appropriate for your course. </dd>
<dt>Group by  Section</dt>
	<dd>Ask students to find an object  that relates to the concept or technique. Depending upon your situation, students can search for actual objects or digital images of the objects. Have students share a photo of the object and explain how it relates to the concept or technique. In addition to activating each students’ prior knowledge, this activity can encourage students to build upon and extend one another’s knowledge. As students share digital images, they can add comments and reflect further on how the objects relate to the concept or technique.<br>
	  <br>
    I have asked students to identify <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iaHe4bV32XeYg_bqnGXXU52ArkQJQmOvxBUkQXhpZc4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">One Significant Object</a> that relates to writing in their field in Discussions in Canvas. As part of their activity, I usually ask students to read and reply to two classmates. While I focus on one object, you can ask students to find any number of objects. The activity easily works for any subject area. All you need to do is change the kinds of objects you ask students to find and discuss.</dd>
<dt> Group Randomly</dt>
	<dd>This strategy’s name explains everything: students are given one minute to write about a topic. A flexible activity, minute papers can be used to gather prior knowledge as well as gauge students’ understanding of concepts covered in class or a reading. I use a minute-papers strategy in Canvas Discussions when I ask students to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dr_GRNeIOYyEwPcEsA7XRyfUXoLEnfuZ_P42WdHn6jc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Share  Workplace Writing Secrets</a>. The activity can be modified for any subject area—just ask for relevant secrets for the project and field being covered.<br>
	</dd>
<dt>Group by Subject Area, Major, and/or College</dt>
	<dd>Similar to the Found Object activity, the Scavenger Hunt strategy asks students to find a variety of objects that meet specific criteria or demonstrate specific ideas related to the subject area. Activities can ask students to find any number of examples. When working online, students can take photos of their finds and share the images online. .</dd>
